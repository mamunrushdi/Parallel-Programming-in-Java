# Parallel-Programming-in-Java

## _This is the first course in [Parallel, Concurrent, and Distributed Programming in Java Specialization by Rice University in Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/pcdp)_

An introductory course of  Parallel Programming in Java by Rice university in Coursera 
Where I've learnt the follwing skills:
1. Theory of parallelism: computation graphs, work, span, ideal parallelism, parallel speedup, Amdahl's Law, data races, and determinism
2. Task parallelism using Java’s ForkJoin framework
3. Functional parallelism using Java’s Future and Stream frameworks
4. Loop-level parallelism with extensions for barriers and iteration grouping (chunking)
5. Dataflow parallelism using the Phaser framework and data-driven tasks

This repository contains 4 mini-project with above mentioned technology, where
1. The First mini project implements __ReciprocalArraySum using RecursiveAction's in Java's Fork/Join Framework (Demo)__
2. The Second mini project implements __Analysing Student Statictis Using Java Parallel Stream__
3. The Thrid mini project implements  __Parallelizing Matrix-Matrix Multiply Using Loop Parallelism__
4. The Fourth mini project implements __Using Phasers to Optimize Data-Parallel Applications__
